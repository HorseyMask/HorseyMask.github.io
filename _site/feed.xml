Welcome, random person, to the first post of the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t have a set idea or plan for the blog yet, but the rough idea is just throwing out my thoughts on things that I’m intereted in. Some of those things would mostly be in tech and anime, but hey, there’s always room for more things later. Who knows, some real life stuff make it in here as well, depending on what I’m thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my projects in various areas (terrible coding pieces, etc) would probably make it in here, as well as random art that I figure out to draw. Still learning the ropes, so don’t expect masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that’s all for now I guess, hopefully I don’t quit this within a few weeks or so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Been thinking of trying out some blogging for a while, and guess this is the first step.
