For me, that was my next semester’s class schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my schedules for the last year were pretty smooth sailing. None of them too jam-packed with tough classes, no 1st period 9AMs, good timings for lunch, etc. Not this semester’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-02-09productivity/everytime(2).png&quot; alt=&quot;Absolute garbage schedule.&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While everything is in Korean, just looking at it at a glance, it already looks like terrible scheduling. 1st periods across the board from Monday to Friday (left to right), a 5 hours CompSci lab, and 3 classes in a row are all factors into making this semester look like a disaster. Not that I can do much about it anyways, since the mandatory classes lined up for me were poor by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After accepting this reality for the coming months, I took a look at how I did work for the past year and the tools I used to get that work done, and tried to see where I can make some changes to make my life less of a hell on earth and more of a manageable chaos. In that process of management, I decided to write this blogpost on the productivity system I’ll try to use for 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analog-tool-bullet-journal&quot;&gt;Analog tool: Bullet Journal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of this year, I decided to look into Bullet Journaling, a proposed “new” method of both keeping track of your life and your tasks. In this process, I read “&lt;em&gt;The Bullet Journal Method&lt;/em&gt;” by Ryder Carroll, the creator of the Bullet Journal system, to make the decision if I should try using the system. While not all of the ideas and thoughts resonated with me completely, I decided that the system was valuable enough to give it a spin. So, I opened up my mostly dormant Traveler’s Notebook, and tried setting up the barebones of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t really give a solid conclusion on the system for myself yet. The fact that I’m on vacation and don’t really have many critical tasks yet kind of impacts how much I can get a use out of it yet. But I have found that keeping a short record of the daily tasks, events, and notes was satisfying. The journal allows me to take a look at past days and reflect on them, as well as set the next day up with intention. As to how well I follow those intentions is a work in progress, but I think it’ll be a great resource and tool for the upcoming semester. I think it’ll allow me to work with more intention in a busy and tiring semester, as well as reflect on how every day went by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, this also gives me an excuse to put my fountain pen to good use, so I might as well kill two birds with one stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analog-tool-coffee&quot;&gt;Analog tool: Coffee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right. This isn’t a new one by any shot, but the way I’m going to be keeping down this black magic liquid is going to change with this semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 9AMs every day, and a commune time of around 1 and a half hours, I’m going to need the caffeine to get through the day, moreso than the past. To lower the amount of money I waste on getting that caffeine, as well as to actually get a good experience out of it, I decided to invest in a coffee grinder and brew my own coffee every day. Might as well make most of the situation that I’ve been thrown into, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, there’s a local roaster literally a walk down the road from my university that roasts the beans on the spot with the order, so I think I could get a really good experience from this venture. Honestly, can’t wait to try this new coffee out, as all I’ve been drinking is pregrinded coffee or coffee brewed from a store. It’s going to be pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-do-list-todoist&quot;&gt;To-do list: Todoist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally getting into the more digital side of things, I decided to change up my todo list application from TickTick to Todoist. While there’s nothing wrong with TickTick, I found that in the past, there was a lot of friction between me inputting tasks into TickTick. So I decided to try moving to Todoist for a while and trial it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the natural language processing for Todoist is already showing to be a lot better that TickTick, albeit there was some issues with notifications for a task that I set for a day. I still need to get used to this new tool, but I am looking forwards to make more use of Todoist with work in the future. The more positive reception among people who use it and the features focused on productivity do make me want to keep on trying it though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;calendar-google-calendar&quot;&gt;Calendar: Google Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have actually never made use of a calendar application before. Kind of surprising, but I just never found a good use for in my working life. I figured that I didn’t really need one, and if I did need to remember an event, I could just use a to-do list app (though I actually never used even a to-do list app very well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-02-09productivity/googlecal.png&quot; alt=&quot;Absolute garbage schedule, but on Google Calendar.&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to start putting a calendar to use in my system, I jumped into Google Calendar and started inputting that horrendous schedule as a calendar. As school hasn’t started for me yet, I don’t have much to add here yet, but I could see various calendars being created here to separate school clubs and events, as well as personal calendars for my own personal work and deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-the-to-do-list-and-calendar-tag-team&quot;&gt;Managing the To-do list and Calendar tag team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there is a lot of intertwining areas between a to-do list and a calendar app, and to use them both effectively, I decided to put some ways to use both these applications effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The to-do list app would hold all the tasks that I need to get done, but I can get it done anytime before the due date. This would include such as homework assignments, exam review, and personal project work. The calendar app on the other hand will contain events that I have to be present for. These include supplementary classes, club meetings, and exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may have seemed obvious, but I was struggling to understand why one would need to use both systems, when it seemed like the two types of applications were interchangeable. For some people, it might as well be. But I want to try using both systems for different types of tasks so that I can get the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also thinking of implementing the analog Bullet Journal system here as a sort of a “hopper”. In the bullet journal, I’ll take a look at my calendar and to-do list and see the tasks that I need and want to get done, and input them in the journal. This way, I’d be able to make sure no tasks get left behind, and to also assure I can do my tasks with more intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, by using both systems as a tag team, with the Bullet Journal also being thrown in, I feel like I could get around without forgetting something important or missing some homework or project work that I needed to have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;note-system-notion&quot;&gt;Note(?) system: Notion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the more new tool in the system, but in the last few months, I started using Notion as mostly a note taking system, but also to keep track of a lot of things in my life. In fact, I migrated all the blog writing to Notion, and I’m writing this blog entry in Notion right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notion is kind of a complicated tool to describe. It seems to be primarily a note taking application, but it can do so much more. One of the standout features are the databases, which allow you to organize and keep track of your information better than a normal note would do. For example, I currently use a database keeping track of all the subscription services that I use, and how much I have to pay per month. Another way that I am looking to use these databases are to organize art commissions that I may start taking in the future (as long as I can actually get good at drawing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organization system is also very interesting, as you basically create what is essentially a webpage from the tools Notion gives you, and fill it with information or links to other pages. This allows you create a sort of a homepage where everything in connected and easily accessible, which is a feature that I really like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-02-09productivity/Notion.png&quot; alt=&quot;My current Notion homepage.&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notion definitely isn’t perfect, and there are a lot of areas where it can use work. The mobile apps are pretty bad, with slow loading times. While there are a lot of connections with other third-party services, I would like more. Some features that I also want are the ability to create forms in Notion to use for clients, and to aggregate responses in the databases. There’s no stylus support, so the only way to input data is on the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I do point out these missing features and issues, Notion still is quite the powerful tool, and I aim to continue learning how to make the most out of it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;handwriting-system-notability&quot;&gt;Handwriting System: Notability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did state in the Notion section that one of its main weaknesses is no handwriting support. While I do like to write a lot by typing, for studying and taking notes, especially for subjects like math, handwriting is definitely the way to go. For this, instead of using paper, I’ve grown to use the iPad and the Apple Pencil for digital handwriting, with my app of choice being Notability. I’ve used Notability for a while, and all the features are a must for a student. You have access to a variety of types of paper for whatever subject matter, ass well as a variety of writing tools you’ll need, such as a highlighter. The killer feature is the audio recording though, as it records audio as you take notes, which allows you to go back easily to the audio section of a certain point of your notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while I do find that I don’t go back and look at my class notes very often, I find it useful to keep myself focused during class, and taking notes during class does allow me to digest the course material better. Also, I find it very useful to use Notability to make things like review sheets, as well as a endless whiteboard of solving practice problems. It’s really been a gamechanger in how I do study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notability, and as an extension the iPad itself, as a whole just made studying and especially using eBook textbooks a lot easier. From lugging around heavy textbooks to holding a tablet device, it really did make life easier as a learning student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must stop here, because going further from here would make this post get off-topic from a productivity system post to a studying app post. Though that isn’t that bad of an idea. I may or may not do a “What’s on my phone/tablet” post just for the sake of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I really want to focus on building a productivity system this semester that I’ll actually use, and more importantly, keep me working and productive. I think writing this post allowed me to gather my thoughts on building that system, and thus get me to actually see reason to use the system. Think I’ll also write a post later on in the semester on how this system is going, and the adjustments that I want to make to it, if any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Sometimes you need a wake-up call to realize something needs to change.

What a year it was, with ups and downs. This year was filled with discoveries and new experiences, especially with starting university back in my home country, but also with a lot of roadblocks and nasty encounters with issues such as academics and social encounters. But that’s all to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I wanted to go over some of the key points that I went through this year, positive and negative, and also some things that I want to work on as personal projects for this winter vacation (and beyond into the next year/decade).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;university---the-ups-and-downs&quot;&gt;University - the ups and downs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 was the year that I finally exited the hellhole that is university admissions and actually started university. Initial reactions to the acceptance was basically elation. I actually didn’t expect myself to get into the university that I got into, and expected myself to go into a “lower tier” university. But amongst the waitlist results, I was able to barely make my way in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting into university, studying was a mixed bag. Some subjects were fine, thanks to prior experience and learning in the IB, while other classes were pretty tough. Some classes that were tough especially were the calculus and physics lab classes. Calculus was mainly due to the fact that I’m simply terrible at calculus. I especially had issues within an exam situation where my weaknesses in memorization of techniques. Physics lab was painful mostly due to the extreme amount of work required. A long lab report, handwritten, every week for a semester was simply just brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But overall, the classes that I did find interest in, such as the CS courses that I had to take (discrete mathematics), were worth listening and learning about. I think I was able to get valuable information that I wasn’t able to get before in high school, and I do feel good about each new concept that I am able to pick up. Even if the concept is tough or if I had to self-study a lot of the material, I found it rewarding to learn these new concepts. Generally, I found university to be overall a positive experience, but with some tough spots here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clubs-and-social-life---a-tough-one&quot;&gt;Clubs and social life - a tough one&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social life is always a tough one for me. I was never the most sociable guy, and in the past, I usually had a tight-knit small group of friends, and nothing really more. So when I threw myself into a new country, in a new school with new people, with a language that I wasn’t necessarily the most familiar with (albeit my native language, somewhat surprisingly), it was really hard to get used with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly looked towards school clubs at my school to interact with more like-minded people. Currently, I’m associated with two clubs, a computer science club orientated towards projects, and an anime/manga club that is primarily focused on drawing and discussion. It’s mostly worked pretty well, as I did indeed meet a lot of people that I enjoyed being with, quickly filling up the hole of loneliness from leaving my old friends from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, I still feel like that there’s some issues that I’m just not able to mend up. Small things like the difference in jargon and memes in Korean that I don’t know ended up causing problems. I felt that if I had I lived in Korea more and put more effort into exposing myself to these new things, I would have had an easier time getting used to everything. So I guess a lot of it was mostly my fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, I feel like there’s some unexplainable little thing that I’m missing here in social life here. Talking to others is still somewhat awkward, stumbling with words and wondering if I should actually say something. Sometimes, I feel like I’m the third wheel in a group, as if I’m merely tagging along, and not considered as a core member of a group. I don’t know what I could do to make it better, but I’d like to work on this area more next year around in social life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s never easy socially, but I am really thankful for those around me that have kept me company over the past year when I was struggling in a new environment. Guess all I can do is try my best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-hobbies---drawing&quot;&gt;New hobbies - Drawing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, as part of joining the anime/manga in my club, I also started to self-learn how to draw. I’ve never serious picked up a pen to draw before, but this year in September, I finally started attempting the uphill road in art. It started pretty rough, as I didn’t know the basics at all. While that first starting point was somewhat depressing, I’m quite happy that I did stick with the process. I purchased a book to get me started on learning the basics of drawing, and I even got into it enough that I invested in a drawing tablet for my computer. Both were pretty invaluable to the whole illustration business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, 3 months into this new hobby, I feel like I did get a lot better than where I started from. I can finally draw something that looks like a person, and while I’m not completely happy with it, I do figure that it is good enough when I look at how much work I’ve put into it in a short period of time. I’m continuously trying to challenge myself with new poses and unfamiliar scenes, and I do hope I’m getting better with all the practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’m really happy about picking up drawing. I’d thought I’d never produce anything from it, but I think I can actually get some work with the medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goals-for-the-new-year&quot;&gt;Goals for the new year&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the new coming year, I do want to try some new things to change my life around just a little bit more for my own benefit (maybe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be more organized and productive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try starting commissions for art.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actually maintain good habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is a pretty abstract goal, but something that I do want to put some work into for this next year. This year overall was productive enough to get everything done, but I think I could do better, and for this next year, I want to try to organize my life a bit more so that I can get a lot more done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I tried to implement more productivity tools, such as a todo list, into my workflow this year, but I usually found myself not using it when I should have, and often forgot to input important tasks into the todo list. This year, I want to find new methods to remedy these kinds of issues in organization and productivity. This is partly why I’m trying implementing Notion into my workflow, to see if I can get a lot of the stuff I work on into one working space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one mainly came from after learning how to draw. I certainly don’t feel like my work isn’t good enough to sell to anyone just yet. However, I do want to get good enough to a point where someone can look at some sample art that I’ve created and want some art created by me for themselves. In the next year, I want to make it an objective to get good enough to maybe open up for commissions and see how far I could get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the third goal is going to be a hard one. Throughout the year, I’ve started some more healthier activities into my daily life, such as exercise. I was also getting a lot more benefit from the exercise, such as being more positive overall. However, due to factors such as academic duties and the overwhelming pressure of finals, I had to put it on hold for a while. This time, however, I want to integrate such positive habits like exercise on a schedule in which even if I’m busy, I’d always have time to perform the habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heading-into-2020&quot;&gt;Heading into 2020&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all that has happened last year, and even in the last decade, I do hope that 2020, hey, let’s also say the next decade, can be one for the better. Just saying that won’t bring it however, I definitely need to put in the work. I’d like to think that I’m ready for that work that I need to put in, but I’m not sure if I’m certain about that. I’d still like to think that I want to put in the work, so I’m hoping that I am really ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to a better year, and a better decade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">2019, another year gone. What a year it was, with ups and downs.

On the surface, mechanical keyboards can be pretty dry. After all, for many starters, there’s mostly the gaming brands of keyboards, along with one brand of choice for switches, that being Cherry. But stepping outside that bubble, there’s another giant world of custom keyboard options, from keyboard layouts and PCBs, keycaps, lubes, and espically keyswitches. Gateron, Kailh, Zealios, are all names in the enthusiast mechanical keyboard community that make switches outside of Cherry. But there’s one switch that’s basically been heralded as legendary in the community - the Holy Panda. For this keyboard build, I finally get to experience the Holy Panda- well, actually a clone of it. Actually, a clone of a clone of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction---the-holy-panda&quot;&gt;Introduction - The Holy Panda&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Panda is very tactile keyboard switch that requires a lot of assembly. It’s essentially a “frankenswitch”, a switch that mixes parts from two different switches, the Invyr Panda and the Halo Clear/True switches. The Halo Clear/True switches are produced and sold by Drop (formally known as Massdrop, which name I prefer), and are relatively easy to acquire now. But the Invyr Pandas, well, they are very much an endangererd species of switches. First produced as a group buy as a normal linear switch, nobody really gave it a second thought, as it wasn’t a very good switch as well in the first place. But, when a certain community member started mixing around parts of switches, and put in the stem of a Halo Clear/True switch inside the housing of a Invyr Panda switch, and one of the world’s most tactile switches were born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most defining traits of the Holy Pandas was their distinct tactility. While others can produce a tactile switch that is very tactile, many saw the Holy Pandas as just better than others. For one, it had pre-travel, meaning that the switch had a certain point of movement between the start of the press and the point where the tactile bump starts, leading for some to have a better feeling. Also, the tactility was described to be as very “round”, meaning that the tactility stayed longer for the duration of the press, and is more gradual than other tactile switches. These contributions just made the Holy Pandas a unique tactile switch that others simpily couldn’t replicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another distinct trait was the sound of the switches. Many regarded the sound of the Holy Pandas as one of the best sounding, espically when properly lubed and inside a case with great acoustics, such as cases made with brass. In fact, there are a ton of YouTube videos showing the typing sound of a Holy Panda, and the comments ooze with praise of the sound. Both the traits of the tactility and the sound made them a highly sought switch for people that were searching for the pinnicale of tactility of a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-drama-with-the-holy-panda&quot;&gt;The drama with the Holy Panda&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think that a keyboard switch is one of the most mundane topics that cannot possibly generate any controversy, but strap on, because the story of the Holy Pandas is a bumpy one. When I said the Invyr Pandas were endangered, it was a true statement. There were very little group purchases for the switches, and at the time, I could only assume that people were not as enthusiastic to buy the Pandas, as the switches by itself weren’t great. But by the time the combination with the Halo Clear/True stems were found and the Holy Pandas were born, the Invyr Panda group buys were long gone. To make matters worse, it was revealed that the moulds for the original Panda housings were destroyed and lost, leading to the price of the Invyr Pandas and also the Holy Pandas to skyrocket. At one point, these Holy Pandas were going for 5 dollars per switch. That’s some outrageous pricing, as even the most expensive switches today go for 12 dollars for 10 switches (thank zeal tax).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bubble of the pricing had to pop, and it did. New movements started to form to reprouduce the Holy Pandas, with two sides headlining it. One side was Massdrop (now Drop), collaborating with the original Invyr, the original Panda switch maker to repair the switch moulds and reproduce Holy Pandas under the original name. Another side was a company going by BSUN, who also produce keyswitches amonst a lot of other electronics parts. They made the BSUN GSUS, a clone of the Invyr Pandas, and started a limited group buy for the switches. Naturally, the community was skeptical of both sides, but at the end, it was confirmed that both the Massdrop Holy Pandas and the BSUN GSUS switches were legitimate, or good enough to be indifferentiable from the originals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we come to YOK. This group(?) produced a switch that was said to be a clone of the BSUN GSUS, which itself is a clone of the Invyr Pandas. This was how far Holy Pandas got. People were willing to pay for a switch that is a clone of a clone of a switch. Anyways, more skeptism started to brew, but this switch was also seen as a legitmate alternative to make Holy Pandas. YOK started with maroon red housings, which were dubed as Holy Red Pandas after assembly, and now has mint green, black, and blue variants, all with different names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that’s enough of a history lesson for the Holy Panda switch. A long and needlessly complicated history. Coming back to the present, I got myself the original YOK Red Pandas, the Halo Clear switches that came with my Massdrop ALT keyboard, and some other parts to make these legendary switches, and try them myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-chosen-parts&quot;&gt;The Chosen Parts:&lt;/h3&gt;

One of the main subjects that I talked about in the past section, the YOK Pandas are one of the only reliably available sources of Invyr Panda clones. With the Invyr Pandas long dead, the GSUS being a one-off group buy, the YOK Pandas are still sold on a variety of stores. I decided to choose the Red Pandas, mostly for the unique color. After all, what other switch is maroon red like this one. Since I’ve already talked back and front about these, I’ll skip talking more about these.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switch 2: Massdrop Halo Clears
The perfect sacrifice for stem parts, I ordered these with the Massdrop ALT keyboard. It wasn’t for the Holy Pandas, as back then there were no notice of the GSUS being produced at that point, and buying Pandas was clearly a lost cause. I did want to try them out, so I made the choice. While these switches were pretty tactile enough, the spring were just way too heavy, and the typing experience was significantly hampered because of these. So, to put them into better use than stick them in the closet and collect dust, better to put them into use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lube: Tribosys 3203
Yes, people lube keyboard switches. While losing some of the tactility, to raise the smoothness of the switches, many people decide to take the time to lube the switches. For a while, Krytox was king in the selection, but recently, a hybrid type of lube called Tribosys came out, and has been very popular for many keyboard enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds, 3203 and 3204, with the 4 being more thicker and preferable for linear switches, with 3 being better for tactile. I went for the 3203, but many other people, such as TaehaTypes, have also been using 3204 as well. I think that it doesn’t really too matter for the Holy Panda or its clones, as the switch is so tactile by itself, so 3204 may even be better for some if the switch proves to be too tactile for some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Springs: 1UpKeyboards 67g gold plated springs
One of the biggest issues of the YOK Pandas was that the springs included with them have horrible spring crunch/ping. Spring crunch is a type of sound that comes from lower quality switches where an audible crunch can be heard whenever the spring is compressed. I didn’t want that for my switches, and I also didn’t like the weight of the springs, so I decided to pick up some new springs as well. So with this, I also was able to do some spring swapping as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switchopener: The Switchcracker 2:
I already used this tool to open up some keyboard switches for a previous project, and now it’s being used again. It is one of the cheapest options that you can find out there to open switches, outside of a flat-head screwdriver, and it is obvious why, as it is a 3D printed plastic switch opener. While it does get the job done, there were some issues with it that may be only on my model, it still got the job done. I’ll get back to this tool later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-process-the-highs-and-the-lows&quot;&gt;The process: the highs and the lows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall process for this keyboard modification looked like this:
	1. Extract all the stems from the Halo Clears.
	2. Open up the YOK Pandas and remove the springs and the stem.
	3. Lube the housing, new springs, and stem carefully and put together the switch.
	4. Install the finished Holy Red Panda in the keyboard.
	5. Repeat.
A simple process, right? On paper, yes. But actually going through the entire process, some parts were a nightmare, especially part 1 and 4. Let’s get through each step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-the-stems-holding-the-urge-to-throw-the-switchcracker-out-the-window&quot;&gt;Getting the stems: holding the urge to throw the Switchcracker out the window&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening the switch of the Halo Clears was not easy at all. In the choices of switches one has in the market today, there are two kinds of switches based on the locking mechanism of the switch. The Cherry style switch, with 4 clips, two on each side, and the Kailh switch, with two big clips. The Switchcracker had prongs that can open both the Cherry and Kailh style switches, and it can open the Cherries really well, but the Kailh…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s pretty bad. The fact that it took like an hour to open around 8 switches shows how frustrating my experience was with my product. The Kailh clips didn’t match with the placement of the prongs on the Switchcracker, which lead to the switch to just not open on the first try. In fact, it took many tries for a single switch. The worst part was I needed to absolutely get through every switch, as I had exactly 67 switches for 67 keys, and I couldn’t just skip one and move on. I needed all the stems without fail. This did take around two infuriating days, and I was able to get the job done at the end, but it did take much too effort than it should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really did want to throw that plastic tool at a wall, but I was able to get the job done. In the future, I would have gone with a metal switchopener that would have higher precision in manufacturing and probably allow for a more easier process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opening-and-lubing-the-yoks--the-better-part-of-the-process&quot;&gt;Opening and Lubing the YOKs — the better part of the process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a much easier process than the previous part. The Switchcracker’s Cherry MX opening prongs are far better designed, and the YOK Pandas use the Cherry MX locking mechanism, so opening the switches was a breeze. Also, since this isn’t the first time that I’ve lubed keyboard switches, the process of lubing did go a lot faster, and I overall used a lot less lube than I did before, so I could see that as a win for this keyboard build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while this process was still the most tedious part of the build, as lubing switches isn’t the most entertaining thing to do, it was still relatively painless compared to the other parts of this keyboard build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to another painful part of this build however…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installing-the-holy-red-pandas---wanting-to-hammer-in-the-switches-on-the-board&quot;&gt;Installing the Holy Red Pandas - Wanting to hammer in the switches on the board&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing these Holy Red Pandas was not an easy task. I think that these switches aren’t built for hotswap-boards, and were intended to be used for boards that used solder. So when I tried to install these switches in my keyboard, there were a lot of fitting issues for some of the switches. For example, some switches simply refused to be inserted firmly in the sockets, which required a lot of force to basically force it in. This basically lead to a lot of sore fingers by the end, which was not pleasant at all to deal with. If these switches weren’t either expensive or somewhat fragile, I would have liked to take a hammer to the switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in this process I realized that some of the switches were just defects. Thankfully, I ordered 70 switches, meaning I had three left over to use. This made the defects easily replaceable, but if I didn’t have extra, I would have been left with an incomplete keyboard build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the end, I was able to get every switch in the keyboard and get everything working. By the end of the build, it took more than a day due to all the issues from opening the switches and installing the switches. But it was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-conclusion-and-review&quot;&gt;Final conclusion and review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… After all of that painstaking work, the question remains. Was it worth getting these switches. For me, the answer was “Yes, somewhat.”. These switches are the most tactile switches that I have used, and as a fan of tactile keyboards, typing on it is a great pleasure. Every task that requires a long typing session, like writing this blog, is a pleasure to write because of the tactile experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for the amount of work required for this build, and the price involved in purchasing these switches, I wouldn’t recommend it to everyone. I was somewhat lucky having Halo Clears on me already, but if you are starting fresh, you would need both the Halo Clears and one of the Panda variants, leading to around $140 for a 70 switch keyboard total. That’s not a small amount of money. Also with the time required to put those keyboards in a custom keyboard is also long, and other parts for a custom keyboard is also expensive. So unless you’re an absolute keyboard nut like me, I wouldn’t really recommend it, and would point you towards other more mainstream options that stil feel decently tactile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as a personal device, I’m glad that I was able to get the Holy Panda experience, and I’m basically keeping these switches to use for my daily typing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, hopefully you enjoyed coming along the journey of the writeup of a somewhat mundane keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">One of the biggest interests I’ve got currently are custom mechanical keyboards. On the surface, mechanical keyboards can be pretty dry. After all, for many starters, there’s mostly the gaming brands of keyboards, along with one brand of choice for switches, that being Cherry. But stepping outside that bubble, there’s another giant world of custom keyboard options, from keyboard layouts and PCBs, keycaps, lubes, and espically keyswitches. Gateron, Kailh, Zealios, are all names in the enthusiast mechanical keyboard community that make switches outside of Cherry. But there’s one switch that’s basically been heralded as legendary in the community - the Holy Panda. For this keyboard build, I finally get to experience the Holy Panda- well, actually a clone of it. Actually, a clone of a clone of it.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What makes a good game?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/games/2019/10/27/What-makes-a-good-game.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What makes a good game?" /><published>2019-10-27T16:45:00+09:00</published><updated>2019-10-27T16:45:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/games/2019/10/27/What%20makes%20a%20good%20game</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/games/2019/10/27/What-makes-a-good-game.html">&lt;p&gt;Since writing up the past CrossCode and Factorio game review, I’ve been thinking about what makes a good game in the first place. What sorts from the good from the bad, and maybe from the good and the best? While thinking about this, I’ve thought of some “tier list”, or rather what matters the most when it comes to a good game, and what doesn’t matter as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this is a very personal list that is completely based on my opinions. Everyone’s priorities are always different, but this is just my choice of qualities. A tier list of factors based on importance probably isn’t even the best idea, but I wanted to write about it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-most-integral-centermost-part-of-a-game-gameplay&quot;&gt;The most integral, centermost part of a game: Gameplay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably very obvious, but it goes over our heads a lot. A game needs to have great gameplay to even go as a passable game. If the gameplay aspect just doesn’t work well with the player, then it simply can’t be a great of a game. This has started to become forgotten a lot due to focuses in other areas of games, such as graphics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the definition of gameplay is way too vast and out of the scope of the blogpost like this. A visual novel would have a completely different gameplay style compared to than an action RPG. But what I am willing to say is that the game’s gameplay must be appropriate to the genre of the game, as well as fun to play with and frustrating to play against. Various elements of gameplay could be movement mechanics, combat system, map/level design, character level progression, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to go through various examples of games with good (and bad) game mechanics. Taking a look at CrossCode and Factorio, two games I’ve recently played and put my thoughts up on this blog, both have great elements of gameplay. With CrossCode, the combat mechanics and level design are both great gameplay elements that I’ve enjoyed greatly, and Factorio’s utter commitment to gameplay through automation is almost overwhelming. However, CrossCode’s crafting and farming mechanics isn’t the most enjoyable gameplay you can have in a game, and sometimes, the dungeons dragged on far too long for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen from these examples, games need a good balance of gameplay elements. Too much gameplay elements to take in, and the player may feel overwhelmed with everything. Too shallow, and the game becomes boring. CrossCode and Factorio both have a good balance most of the time, but sometimes as seen before, it’s not perfect. But hey, nothing is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-1-b-to-the-1-a-story&quot;&gt;The 1-B to the 1-A: Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story in a game is almost as important as gameplay. In fact, for certain games and genres, such as visual novels, it can be even more important than the gameplay itself. For others, story is far less important. But most of the time, both take the front seat of a game, with gameplay at the driver’s seat and story riding shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While gameplay is the forefront of the game, grabbing all your attention, story takes the background and grabs your interest for the game. The setting, characters, dialogue, plot, and lore all contribute to getting your interest and keep you playing the game and to make you a fan of the game or franchise. I’d say gameplay is important for the immediate enjoyment of the game, but in the long run, I’d say that the story keeps you in and keeps people to like the game for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories in games take various forms, from emotional tearjerkers to over-the-top humor. Stories also differ from what the game intends to do with it. Visual novels and narrative driven games place story in the center of the game. Putting CrossCode in the limelight again, while the gameplay is the main entree, the story does not falter, and delivers a compelling story with likable characters, a interesting plot and decent setting all help give the game extra shine. Another title that I remember to have fantastic stroy or storytelling methods are NieR Automata, Other games, like DOOM, puts story more as side lore for the diehard fans to follow, and to find within the game as either side notes or easter eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these have in common to serve the purpose of the game. If the type of game calls for a story that isn’t right up in the player’s face, then a simple story with non-complex writing is fine. But if the game requires a deep story and lore, and fails to deliver on it, it really hurts the quality of the game. Poorly written dialogue, a shallow setting, and one-dimensional characters can all contribute to this. Another common pitfall is also the poor ending, where the game went along so well for most of the game only to collapse with a rushed and unsatisfactory ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to say is that not all games call for the deep story that we see as important. But when a game does need such a story, it really needs to deliver that to be called a good game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-backup---musicsound--graphics&quot;&gt;The backup - Music/Sound &amp;amp; Graphics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If gameplay and story are at the front seats of the car getting to the destination, music and graphics are at the back seat for support. Both of them wouldn’t be able to save a game that has poor gameplay, story, or both. But it can elevate a game from good to excellent when both are used effectively. Between the two, I’d say music is more important to a game, but the case for graphics can also be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music in an already fleshed out game that has the gameplay and story down is crucial to seal the deal for it to be considered as a good game. The music works mostly with the story, and sometimes with the gameplay, to help accentuate areas in the game that need it. Character theme songs that fit the character writing, songs that cue in for scenarios to help the player feel the emotions the developer wanted, all depend on the game. A game without an appropriate soundtrack languishes as just an average game, while games with great ones are able to be ingrained in our minds as classics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some games that I find to have a stellar soundtrack that fits the game are NieR Automata, Hotline Miami, and Cave Story. While there are many other games that have a great soundtrack that I didn’t specify here, all of them make the most of them ingame to match the game at that point in time to great effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphics on the other hand is less of an importance for me quality wise. What is important for graphics is if the type of graphics fits the gameplay and story. The artstyle needs to be consistent and follow the game design of the rest of the game as well. The graphics don’t need to be fancy at all, as long as it is able to fit this requirement. Pixel-art graphics are fine, and may even add the the game experience more than if the artsyle was realistic, as long as it fits the feeling of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One great usage of graphics is Team Fortress 2. While the quality of the graphics in the game are nothing to write home about, the cartoonish, comedic artstyle of the game has allowed the game to stand out from other orthodox military shooters. This creative choice in graphics style alone has allowed it to have a longer lifespan than many other multiplayer shooters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, graphics and music serve more of a supporting feature of games, to help good games become great or excellent ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-tidbits-and-dealbreakers&quot;&gt;Other tidbits and dealbreakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to the final spurt, there are some final tripwires that can cause a game to be excellent in all four areas spoken before, to absolutely hit rock bottom and become a dud. One of these is microtransactions, abbreviated as MTX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With microtransactions making itself known a lot more within games outside mobile ones, it needs to be said that one needs to be careful around them. If the MTX purchases makes a difference in the actual gameplay itself and not buying it gives you a disadvantage, then full stop, the game is probably not going to be good at all. Even if the game hits the spot for the other 4 qualities, a simple MTX inclusion of this kind can ruin the game, simply because you need to pay on top of the game’s original price to enjoy it. The most MTX purchases should be are cosmetic additions to your game, such as hats, skins, etc, and even those could be an issue for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration for the game’s quality can be put through the idea of DLC and expansion packs. These two additions to a game can either make a game even better, or lower the quality as well. DLC and expansion packs, if well done, can add new features for gameplay, new stories and worlds to explore for the story, and much more that enhances the gameplay. The bigger additions are being seen more towards expansion packs, and really add a new aspect of games that can make a good game even better. However, DLC can also be used to put features that should have been in the original game in the first place under a paylock, only to accentuate the lower quality of a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many other factors that can be seen as factors that impact a game’s quality. Mod support, frequency of updates, and much more can affect a game. But I think I’ve gone through most of the qualities that do matter the most, and do feel that this is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With summer vacation coming to an end, I’ve decided to do some back-to-school shopping on the tech side. This semester is especially going to be travel heavy with no dorm to rely on, so I’ve bought some gear that’ll help me survive the more “road warrior” lifestyle I’ll go through this semester. Also, I’ve thinking of some changes to the EDC for this semester, which I’ll also get into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-gear&quot;&gt;The new gear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/8-29edcupdate/20190829_144202.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluetooth Keyboard - Logitech K380&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got this keyboard refurbished, which was a great deal. Even if the keys don’t have Korean legends on them, I don’t type that much in Korean nor do I look at the keyboard when I type, so more power to me I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, I was planning to get the Logitech Slim Combo keyboard case, but the case was a lot more expensive than I wanted it to be. The case itself also added way too much bulk to the iPad, which was a bit unsightly. Worries about the kickstand and how well it’ll hold up from long sessions with the Apple Pencil was the final straw. From there, I looked to just get a cheaper, more universal bluetooth keyboard that I can use with devices other than the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, back to the K380. Right now I’m typing this entry up on the iPad with the K380, and it’s not as bad as an experience that I thought it would be. I usually use a mechanical keyboard most of the time, and while comparing this keyboard to a mechanical one is unfair, the tactile feedback is quite acceptable, especially on the go. It’s definitely a productivity booster on the iPad, and makes the iPad a more formidable laptop replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue that I did face while typing is the circular keycap shapes. While it’s not as big of a deal as I make it, the circular keycaps does somewhat impact my typing speed and accuracy, as I am used to square keycaps. Also, the keyboard is a bit more low profile and lower that I am comfortable with, making typing a bit harder. Both of these things are probably stuff that I can get used to over time, so I think that I just need more time with this keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Battery - Xiaomi Mi Power Bank 3 Pro, 20000mAh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one just arrived yesterday, along with a Quick Charge 3.0 (QC 3.0) + USB PD charging brick. While I didn’t really feel a need for a battery bank before, as I always had access to an outlet near me, whether it was at home, or at a dorm. But, with my phone’s battery draining a lot faster than the start of the first semester, and more time on the road this semester, I thought I’d need it this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first wanted a 26800mAh battery, as it allows for the most battery capacity while still being able to take on an airplane, but they turned out to be a lot rarer on the Korean markets. So I just settled with Xiaomi’s latest 20000mAh battery bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the spec sheet, the USB-A ports does look to match QC 3.0 standards, and the USB-C port supports USB-PD, which allows up to 45W of power delivery. This was what sold me, as I did want to have a battery bank that could support charging a laptop on the go. Though my current laptop doesn’t support USB-PD charging (I think), I thought it would be useful for the future. The USB-C will come in handy for charging my iPad though, as it does support USB-PD quick charging, and for my phone, which supports both QC and USB-PD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to put it to the test with the school year and facing conditions when I need to use it, but so far, it feels like a solid battery bank that I could rely on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-proposed-changes&quot;&gt;The (proposed) changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laptop: &lt;del&gt;ASUS Zenbook UX310UQ&lt;/del&gt; No laptop at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds crazy, right? A CS Student without a laptop on the go while studying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear me out here though. I did say it was proposed changes. Nothing is final here. I realized that my laptop itself is pretty hefty with all the other stuff in my EDC bag. With a lot of movement expected next semester, I thought to myself if I could lessen the weight of the stuff I carry everyday, I can save a lot of effort while moving around. And so, I thought of taking my laptop out of my everyday carry in favor of the iPad, especially with the addition of the Logitech K380 keyboard, and possibly a wireless moue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are limitations with this choice. While the iPad is great for taking notes, drawing, writing (with a keyboard) and other kinds of lighter productivity tasks, there is one caveat: coding.  By itself, the iPad is very limited into code compilation and resources. There are certain apps such as Pythonista that does allow some coding, but there still is a lot of limitations, such as coding language choice. While iPadOS did make strides into making the iPad a laptop replacement, coding is still hard on it. I could also host a remote Visual Studio Code environment to use anywhere with the iPad, but that takes a lot of effort and also requires constant internet access. In the meantime, while I’m connected to the school network, I can SSH to write and compile my code using Vim on the university’s servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, I am planning to go through a week of using the iPad as my main device, when school starts. A lot of other people have tried doing this, with varying degrees of success depending on what their profession is and what their requirements were. I want to see how using the iPad as their main device as a CS student would be like. Taking it a step further, I can also ditch the desktop and only use the iPad as my computer device for the week. I know it probably won’t be very easy with all the limitations that I didn’t foresee, but I think it would be a great experience and a trial to see if the iPad can actually replace my laptop on an everyday carry basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other random bits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also decided to throw my old Magic Mouse that I purchased way back, as iPadOS now has mouse support, albeit pretty poor support. The scroll gestures don’t work for the Magic Mouse yet, and I guess that’s what I get for purchasing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the big proposed changes, there was a wallet change to a more compact one that is more focused on cards rather than bills. Very uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also was playing with the idea of a smartwatch, but the side of not investing in one is mostly winning just due to the price. The Galaxy Watch Active 2 did look pretty good though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the final image of my updated EDC. You can check out the original EDC blogpost that I linked above for full details. I did keep the ASUS laptop in there for now because it still isn’t out just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that all from me this time with the updates.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Original everyday carry (EDC) post here</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Games I’ve been playing - CrossCode and Factorio</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/games/2019/08/22/Some-games.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Games I've been playing - CrossCode and Factorio" /><published>2019-08-22T02:41:00+09:00</published><updated>2019-08-22T02:41:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/games/2019/08/22/Some-games</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/games/2019/08/22/Some-games.html">&lt;p&gt;The first summer vacation of university is here, and after working on some university stuff from June to July, I met August with the most free time I’ve had in a while. To wind down from the burn-out from June to July, I’ve started to play some games in my Steam library that I bought but haven’t touched in a while. While doing so, I basically opened a Pandora’s Box of sinking a bunch of time into two particular games that I wanted to write about today. These two games, as seen from the title, are Factorio and CrossCode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being honest here, I still haven’t finished both games (Not that you really ever finish Factorio though), so I can’t give a complete review for both games. But after a week of sinking time into both and enjoying them both, I wanted to write something about my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crosscode&quot;&gt;CrossCode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/8-22crossfactorio/20190822022312_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
CrossCode was a game that I didn’t have much expectations for before playing. In fact, I never knew that this game was a thing until I heard Linus from LinusTechTips talk about it on a livestream when asked for some games he was playing at the time. With that single entry point, I decided to buy it during this year’s summer sale, and haven’t really played it until now. But after about a week of playing and having tested the waters enough, I can say I’m enjoying it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You play as Lea, a player of &lt;em&gt;CrossWorlds&lt;/em&gt;, a virtual MMORPG. Due to various circumstances that I haven’t reached in the story as of now, her speech functions in the game have malfunctions, leading her to only speak in certain phrases. While playing the main story path of CrossWorlds, you meet various supporting characters along the way, such as Emilie and C’tron, that are charming in their own ways. While I haven’t finished the full story of the game, there haven’t been any real antagonists or have seen any final objectives of the game, but so far, I’ve seen some great progress in the story, such as tidbits of Lea’s identity. It’s kind of mysterious, honestly, as I can feel there is something underlying the mostly cheery storylines I’ve been experiencing so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with this plot, I feel like CrossCode really shines in the gameplay. The basics of combat come in 4 forms: melee, ranged, dash, and guard. With all of these basics, CrossCode enhances with special abilities called combat arts and elemental forms. Combat arts allow more powerful moves to be performed from all 4 combat basics. Most of these  for melee, ranged, and dash that I’ve seen can be categorized as either large AoE attacks that distributes damage equally or focused, more damaging attacks for one foe. Guard arts are mostly dedicated to well, self-protection as expected. These combat arts are earned with leveling up and using skill points to level up either Lea or unlock new combat arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/8-22crossfactorio/mpv_9lbJVhY79P.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Charging a melee attack, one of the combat arts.&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elemental forms open up even more abilities to Lea with alternative combat arts and characteristics. These forms are gradually unlocked along the story, and so far I’ve unlocked 2 of 4, which are heat and ice. While adding new combat arts that are unlocked with separate skill points,, Elemental forms also introduce attack resistances and weaknesses types to the gameplay. For example, a heat based form attack would allow more damage done to an ice-based enemy, and so on. There’s a lot of ways to mix elemental forms on the fly while in combat that I haven’t mastered at all. Simply put, there’s just a lot of strategy that can be implemented in the combat of CrossCode. Or you can just throw that all in the bin and do as you please. It’ll still probably work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also another standout of CrossCode is the level and map design. The levels of the world are a mix of 2D and 3D, where the world itself is 2D, but height is a factor to level design as to what kind of areas you can access. For example, there are some areas that you cannot access unless you are on a surface at a certain height. Therefore, climbing and parkouring around the levels is a key feature of the exploration of worlds, especially if you want all the hidden chests in an area. Also, the puzzles in the levels, especially in the dungeons, can be pretty challenging. I had to search up some walkthroughs for the solution for a certain part of the level, and felt dumb afterwords after how simple the solution was. However, the puzzles did feel rewarding after you found the solution by yourself as you spent more time on the puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/8-22crossfactorio/mpv_O6bxOSoR7m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of one of the starting areas. The different heights of the map can be seen.&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphics and music also are great and fit the purpose of the game. As a game looking to reenact retro games with the graphics, the pixel art style hits the spot, and yet still manages to be detailed enough to be seen as a intended design choice and not to be “lazy” as some people may see the pixel artstyle. The soundtrack doesn’t go towards retro chiptune styled songs, but that’s fine by me, as the music fits each area of the world you are in, as well as the combat situation you are in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I don’t really like about CrossCode is the length of some of the levels, especially the dungeons. While having a long and fleshed out story going with the game is always great, there are times where I did feel that the game was getting a bit tiring to play. In some dungeons, I felt like it should have ended a while ago, yet there were still a lot more keys and puzzles to unlock before I can approach the final boss. Maybe I’m just no good at the game, but that’s just what I felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that point aside, the highs of CrossCode are high, and I feel like for anyone looking for a charming 2D RPG with surprisingly deep combat mechanics and a pretty good story, I can recommend CrossCode, especially if they are a fan of the retro artstyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;factorio&quot;&gt;Factorio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/8-22crossfactorio/20190822023053_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
Ah, Factorio. This “game” is better fit of the title of one of the biggest time eaters you’ll even start. On a first glance, it looks like a dull game that looks like it belongs in the bargain bin, but as you play, you start to forget the time passing, and before you know it, all you can see is a spaghetti of conveyer belts, inefficient resource management, and constantly running out of coal for your steam engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting off with the (almost) nonexistent: Story. There’s a campaign of around 4 levels that serve as tutorials, that kind of piece together a story. But seriously, all you need to know is: you’re stranded on some planet. You need to escape. Launch a rocket starting with almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphics are also a very deemphasized area of the game, with washed out colors and simple colors used. But that’s all that Factorio needs. It’s all about the functionality of your factory, not how it looks. Music is also somewhat forgotten about for me, as I tend to just listen to podcasts in the background and not the ingame music, but others do seem to like the music a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that put, the gameplay elements of this game is almost bottomless. You start simple enough, with mining coal, iron, and copper, and using those basic materials to start building a factory that produces and consumes electricity, creates products, and performs research with the final aim to launch the rocket. Speaking of research, While doing this, your main objective throughout the game will be to perform research by creating science packs. Each research advances to more weapons, products, and kinds of science packs, which require more complex crafting recipes. Before you know it, there’s an overwhelming amount of ingame resources that you’ll be juggling around to try to create these science packs and do research. Oh, and the midst of all of this, you need to protect your factory from hostile enemies on the planet you’re on, and they really don’t take the pollution you’re causing from your factory. With a more complex factory comes more energy usage, which usually comes with more pollution, and therefore more enemies to fight off against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With complexity increasing, automation is key, and there is a bunch of resources at your disposal to accomplish this—whether you decide to take advantage of all of them is your choice. There are assembling machines, robots, trains, circuitry, and much more. I couldn’t even figure out how to get an automated train system to work out in my factory, let alone touch the robots. You’re going to be looking at a lot of tutorials and the wiki while playing this game for the first time, that’s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also with increasing complexity follows dropping efficiency. As your factory grows, you start to forget about some parts of your factory until it’s too late, and then you realize that the once efficient system you built when things were simpler is now a bottleneck. Rebuilding is painful, but a necessary part of Factorio, at least on your first run, and constant search for the most efficient systems often lead to a completely different factory structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factorio’s post-endgame is hilariously huge. Even after the rocket launch, there are so much other new things that one can go after. Things like launching more rockets, nuclear power are just some things you can pursue even after you finished your final objective. Also, the modding community for Factorio is also pretty big, and you can always find a new mod to spice up the endgame with even more tasks. You can also find mods that completely enhance the game to feature new gameplay mechanics and resources, which just increases the complexity even further. Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes one issue with the game for me. I tended to want to give up on the current mess of a factory that I had and start over. Sometimes this is a ok idea, as you would have learned from the mistakes of the horrible spaghetti monster you have constructed, and could (hopefully) make a better factory by starting over. However, this isn’t great when you’re 20 hours deep into a single factory. Interest can be lost in the current factory, while starting a new map just seems insane. This can be remedied with pure determination and love for sinking more time into your factory, but sometimes it can feel very daunting to do so. I guess a break is always a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you need a giant time sink of a “game” that can suck the remaining life that you have into micromanaging a virtual factory to achieve peak efficiency, grab a couple of podcasts and sit down. Factorio is a ride that’ll keep you busy for hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/8-22crossfactorio/20190822023111_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My hilariously messy factory.&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a long writeup for both of these games that I’ve been really into over this August. Almost forgot to finish writing this up due to wanting to continue playing. But there it is, my thoughts of two awesome games. Hope you get to try one of these games, or both of them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The first summer vacation of university is here, and after working on some university stuff from June to July, I met August with the most free time I’ve had in a while.

&lt;p&gt;It took me a long time to think of how I wanted to write this blog post, and I’m still not very sure how I’d want to structure it. But here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kyoto-animation---the-one-and-only&quot;&gt;Kyoto Animation - the one and only&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When many people are asked what their favorite anime studio is, a great amount of names come up. There’s a lot of famous ones, such as Studio Ghibli and Madhouse that are loved by many for various reasons. But one name stands out for me, as it does for many others. Kyoto Animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyoto Animation, shortened to Kyoani by many (as I will in this post), is a gem within the anime industry, both in their anime projects and their system of work. Approaching how Kyoani works first as a studio, the main difference between Kyoani and other anime studios is that everyone working for Kyoani is hired full-time. Most people working at other studios are more like freelancers, jumping from project to project, sometimes for different studios as well. Hence, they are usually paid by each project they accomplish. However, Kyoani’s employees are all on payroll, working with a monthly salary. This may sound extremely basic, but in the anime industry, this is unheard of. This basically ends up making a job at Kyoani much more stable. In a world of terrible working conditions for animators in the anime industry, Kyoani was a shining beacon of difference in working environments for anime studios. A role model for other studios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a role model Kyoani was for their quality of work. Every anime project, TV, Movie, OVA, or anything else in between, has always shown the highest quality of art, animation, and sound that was available. For example, the work and attention to detail in Violet Evergarden, a Kyoani production, was simply impeccable, and that alone made it a marvel to watch. Other works, such as K-ON and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya are no exception, and this attention to detail that Kyoani has always makes every anime special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just the production value, but also the content of writing of the works. What should be a mundane slice-of-life view of someone’s life always looked fun, lively, and yet comfy in anime like K-ON, Tamako Market, and Lucky Star. Other anime took this slice-of-life and turned it to intriguing mystery, such as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Hyouka. Finally, in Nichijou, it took slice-of-life into a wacky, slapstick comedy that never failed to get laughs. Other Kyoani productions took more emotional paths, such as CLANNAD, A Silent Voice, and Violet Evergarden, that makes watching each minute harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mixture allowed Kyoani to make anime that I found to always be a must watch. Kyoani took existing source materials and flipped them into animated masterpieces of their own,and in some cases, went above and beyond the source. Out of the 12 animes that I gave a perfect 5 stars on my list, 9 of them are Kyoani productions. I wanted to write about one in particular that impacted me greatly, that being Liz and the Blue Bird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;liz-and-the-blue-bird&quot;&gt;Liz and the Blue Bird&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liz and the Blue Bird is a movie of a side story off of Sound Euphonium, another anime project based on a light novel that Kyoani has worked on. The movie’s main focus is on the relationship between the two main characters, Mizore and Nozomi. The two are set to play a duet of a music piece named Liz and the Blue Bird, a piece based off a fairy tale on the relationship of a bird and a girl. Throughout the hardships of practicing the song, the movie shows the relationship between Mizore and Nozomi are challenged, and throughout allusions to the fairy tale and other motifs such as university and going on separate paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many audiences and critics didn’t like Liz and the Blue Bird. Some people thought it was just boring, without much substance to go on (as many people think about some Kyoani works). Others thought the drama and tension between Mizore and Nozomi’s friendship was too weak to be significant. However, this movie affected me greatly, especially due to the circumstances that I was going through at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went to watch this movie at theatres at October, I was fresh off graduating from high school, and separated from long friends across borders. Another significant issue was that I still didn’t have a university to go to. Having been rejected from every school so far, I was still waiting until the end of December for final waitlist results. My best friend especially hit me hard, already being in the middle of his semester at a university that I could only dream of getting into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While watching the movie, I felt a lot like Mizore, feeling uncertain about the future, feeling like I was falling behind of my best friend, who could only be drawn parallels to Nozomi at this point. But most of all, I asked the same question that Mizore did: Am I the Blue Bird, not wanting to let go to the past and friends, or am I Liz, who can let go of the Blue Bird, for the bird’s own good? Liz and the Blue Bird really did help me learn that regardless of the past and others, I needed to carve my own path that works for me. While friends are great, ultimately I need to make the choices for my own path for myself. With the uncertainty that I was going through at the time, I really needed this lesson, and Liz and the Blue Bird was able to teach me this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from personal connections, the art, music, and other production values for Liz and the Blue Bird worked perfectly for me. It strayed off from the original artstyle of Sound Euphonium, and sticked to a more watercolor style, which I loved. I especially thought it fit well with the fairy tale setting of Liz and the Blue Bird, making it feel like a picturebook. All the character designs, while more simpler than its Sound Euphonium counterparts, had its own charm and beauty. The music, especially the duet performances of Mizore and Nozomi, were also great, not only in quality, but also telling the story. From the unsynced performances at the start to the great final performance of the duet at the end, it really showed the relationship of the two change throughout the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Kyoani works, such as A Silent Voice, do stand out more than Liz and the Blue Bird on its own. And I do agree those works are brilliant, having given A Silent Voice a 5 star rating as well. But in my personal circumstances that I had when I entered the movie theatre that day, Liz and the Blue Bird just clicked for me. I never felt more relatable to a movie, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all comes in reflection to the tragic arson incident at Kyoani’s Studio 1. With the death count at 35, and with some key names of Kyoani’s directors being revealed as deceased, I’m still honestly in denial. Beyond the tragedy of lost of lives, some of the best talent in animation in the world were erased in a single, terrible accident. While Kyoani will surely not go down from this incident, I do feel like it would be a while until they get back on their feet, and I wish them all the best in recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The EDC</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/personal/2019/07/12/The-EDC.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The EDC" /><published>2019-07-12T03:36:00+09:00</published><updated>2019-07-12T03:36:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/personal/2019/07/12/The-EDC</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/personal/2019/07/12/The-EDC.html">&lt;p&gt;To start this blog with actual meaningful content, I thought that I’d just go over my everyday carry, or EDC. It’s basically the stuff that I usually have on me on a daily basis if I’m going anywhere outside the house. Usually this would vary between if I’m just out meeting someone, or I’m headed to a class or out expecting to do actual work. With the list of stuff, I’ll just give a mini-review of each item that I would carry around and use every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bare-minimum&quot;&gt;The bare minimum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I’d carry if I’m traveling around where a lot of luggage would hamper my experience or otherwise be unnecessary, or if there’s a danger that I’d lose something. Some scenarios would be going out to meet some friends, running small errands, or just a short walk outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phone: Samsung Galaxy S9+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mobile phone of choice. Still consider it the last Android phone that keeps the design choices that I hold important, the most important two being no notches and including the 3.5mm headphones jack. Storage flexibility with the micro-SD card slot earns brownie points for flexibility, but I got the 256GB model in the first place, so I found little use for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things hardware-wise, the Exynos 9810 hasn’t failed me in any usage case yet, with no slowdowns bad enough that I remember of. Also, the extra battery size on the S9+ is also great, and to my personal use, the phone lasts me the whole day and then some. However, I’m not really a heavy smartphone user, so my experience may be vastly different to yours. Finally, the OLED screen, following Samsung trends, is great and accurate enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much of a camera guy in the first place, so the cameras on the S9+ is great, and I doubt I’d actually need more camera power then I have on this phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software wise, I really like One UI, Samsung’s Android implementation, as I’m personally a fan of the design choices made. One UI having more features added to Android is just icing on the cake, such as screenshot options. Though I do still use Nova Launcher as my default launcher to replace the stock One UI launcher, just because I’m just more used to my setup on Nova Launcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Galaxy S9+ is basically my ideal phone for now, until the industry changes trends and actually puts back headphone jacks and no notches on the table. Notches may be gone with more technological advances in glass and display technology, but I’m not so sure for the headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wallet: Smartphone &amp;amp; Phone case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m traveling light, I rarely find the need to store paper money or a large selection of cards at all. I’ve grown used to mobile payment systems, like Samsung Pay, so I don’t find much use in a wallet in a light travel situation. When I do need to make a physical payment, the phone case that I use that has room for one card suffices. I just keep my student ID in there, which doubles as a debit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch: Swatch New Gent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the best watch, I know. Blame the 10 year old me that picked it out and never actually really wore it. Just got back into wearing a watch on my EDC, and guess this was the only choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the timetelling is still accurate when correctly set. Just getting it perfectly set, right to the second is pretty challenging sometimes, if you really want to be precise. However, the date mechanism on the watch is always a day late, with no amount of adjusting getting it to be fixed. That always bugs me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, since I’m not that much of a watch enthusiast, and since I still dig the orange/black color scheme, I think the watch just suits me fine. As long as it can tell the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earphones/IEM : VSonic GR07 Classic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent upgrade from my ATH-IM70. I was looking for a sub-100$ upgrade, and by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://crinacle.com/ranking-list/&quot;&gt;crinacle’s list&lt;/a&gt; and looking at the graphs frequency graphs, I came to the conclusion that the GR07 would be the best fit, and it was a great choice. Chi-Fi may be cheaper, but as long as the quality is there, I’m fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I love good audio, I can’t trust myself to give a detailed review of audio products, and therefore I’ll just end it by saying that the GR07s are great for any song that I listen it with. I find it as a great jack-of-all-trades IEM that I’m happy with listening to anything with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accessory kit that came with it, while including a lot of stuff, wasn’t the best fit for me. The earhooks were too big for my small ears, and I ended up just using the wire as hooks. The foam eartips were fine, not Comply foam, but the isolation is good and seems like the material will laster longer than Comply. I appreciated the large selection of eartips as well. Finally, I don’t use the included carrying case at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-complete-set&quot;&gt;The complete set&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This EDC kit would be if I’m going somewhere to get actual work done, such as going to a class. It can also be used if I’m going to be out all day, and I don’t know what I would need while on the road. This EDC kit is inclusive of the previous “the bare minimum” kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wallet : Kipling Wallet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more room to carry things in this kit, I do carry a wallet around in my backpack, but it is still rarely used. It holds my ID, other debit cards that I use much less often, as well as cash for emergencies when I would need it. I still either use Samsung Pay, or my card on my S9 case first, so the payment options here are just backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laptop : ASUS Zenbook UX310U&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually bought this laptop on a whim when my old MacBook Pro from 2010 was simply too slow for any tasks, with the keyboard being broken just another reason to get an upgrade. Was looking into getting a ThinkPad, but with the stores I visited not having any, I decided to go with this ASUS laptop. With a i7-7500U, the laptop is fast enough for any task that I need to do on the go, whether that be typing an essay or doing coding assessments. The GeForce 940MX is also just fast enough for any random indie game that I feel like playing at the time, or if I feel for a quick round of TF2. I don’t game on the go often, so it works in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly though, the main reason I got this laptop is the ability to have a HDD + SSD combo in a laptop. Really like this feature, as I still listen to music from files, and I like having a cheap storage option like a HDD, even on a laptop. This feature on a relatively thin laptop turned this otherwise generic laptop into the perfect laptop for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with the rise of laptop CPUs with more cores, and Intel’s CPU issues with security and hyperthreading, I have been thinking of getting a new laptop to replace this one soon. For me, the new ThinkPads with AMD mobile CPUs are looking really attractive. Now only if they had room for a HDD + SSD combo…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pencilcase : Nomadic PE-09&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually managed to never lose this pencilcase for like 4 years now. Guess it’s just a testament to how much I like it. The pencilcase is huge, which allows me to carry all my stationary items that I might need, and then some. Some highlights here is my Lamy Safari, Pentel GraphGear 1000, and the Kuru Toga Advance. The Safari is a great starter fountain pen, and (hopefully) the only one I’ll buy. The GraphGear is my go-to mechanical pencil usually, especially for maths and sciences. The Kuru Toga Advance is my backup mechanical pencil, but also for long writing sessions due to its turning point. Other things that I usually carry around in the pencilcase would be a USB drive and the Apple Pencil. Speaking of the Apple Pencil…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tablet : iPad Air, 3rd Generation + Apple Pencil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my new favorites to add to the work EDC. While I am a big fan of Android, the tablet area is, for a lack of a word, miserable. Hence turning to the only Apple product I’d praise - the iPad. Its main purpose is basically leading the forefront of my paperless movement—and it’s really shown in my workflow. Notability, my note-taking app of choice, has taken over both notebooks and scratch paper. Whenever I’m in class, solving math problems, or studying for an exam, Notability is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the iPad allowed me to grow a new hobby—drawing. Procreate, my drawing app of choice, just makes art fun, and I’ve started to self-learn how to draw. I’ve also pushed myself to actually draw stuff, whether that be fanart of my favorite anime shows or original creations of myself. I’ve also purchased Affinity Design with the intent to try to learn some vector art as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than those two main usages, I don’t really use it much other than occasionally consuming media on it, and I feel like I’m not getting the full potential out of it. But I do feel like for a lot of the other tasks I do, a laptop fits me more when I’m on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’ve been trying to use the iPad exclusively during class lectures, and honestly, it’s been a game changer. I’ve even thought of buying a keyboard case for it to get even more use out of it. Especially with iPadOS coming soon that’ll deliver a lot of much needed features to the iPad, I feel like the iPad will just get even more useful. If I don’t need a full-blown desktop OS to perform tasks like coding, the iPad can probably be used instead of a laptop in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notebook: TRAVELER’S notebook, Regular size.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have mentioned that I’m starting to go paperless, I still keep this paper notebook along with me wherever I go, just in case I still need paper to write on. The Traveler’s Notebook system allows me to keep 3 separate notebooks all in the same notebook, and I have a lined notebook, a blank notebook, and a monthly calendar. The lined paper would be used for general notes, while the blank paper would be used for random doodles I want to draw on paper. Finally, the monthly calendar is used as a planner to jot down future events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically use the LAMY Safari exclusively on this notebook, and the paper quality shows when I use it with the Safari. Even though the paper is thin, there is no bleeding behind, making it a great experience to write or draw on. While it was pretty expensive when I bought it during my trip in Japan, I still highly recommend it if you want a quality notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculator: TI-Nspire CX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started using this graphing calculator in my IB days, and to this day is my calculator of choice. Does most things that I want it to do in mathematics, and if it doesn’t work, it’s probably either that I’m in the wrong, or it needs CAS features. The nSolve function has changed my life, and the powerful graphing features helped me in a pinch to find solutions the normal calculator features couldn’t get. Now if only I didn’t make the mistake of updating the OS, then I could have modified the OS and even install CAS features on it. Bummer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water Bottle : Random vacuum flask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a normal vacuum flask that I picked up at a store. Keeps hot things hot, cold things cold. Does vacuum flask things well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, think that covers all the stuff I’d carry on a regular basis. May have missed stuff here and there, and/or may have upgraded, added, or removed some stuff in the future, so I guess this blog entry will stay a live document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry has gotten way too long, so I’ll end it here. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">To start this blog with actual meaningful content, I thought that I’d just go over my everyday carry, or EDC. It’s basically the stuff that I usually have on me on a daily basis if I’m going anywhere outside the house. Usually this would vary between if I’m just out meeting someone, or I’m headed to a class or out expecting to do actual work. With the list of stuff, I’ll just give a mini-review of each item that I would carry around and use every day.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First step</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/personal/2019/07/08/First-step.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First step" /><published>2019-07-08T01:41:55+09:00</published><updated>2019-07-08T01:41:55+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/personal/2019/07/08/First-step</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/personal/2019/07/08/First-step.html">&lt;p&gt;Been thinking of trying out some blogging for a while, and guess this is the first step. Welcome, random person, to the first post of the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t have a set idea or plan for the blog yet, but the rough idea is just throwing out my thoughts on things that I’m intereted in. Some of those things would mostly be in tech and anime, but hey, there’s always room for more things later. Who knows, some real life stuff make it in here as well, depending on what I’m thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my projects in various areas (terrible coding pieces, etc) would probably make it in here, as well as random art that I figure out to draw. Still learning the ropes, so don’t expect masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that’s all for now I guess, hopefully I don’t quit this within a few weeks or so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Been thinking of trying out some blogging for a while, and guess this is the first step.
