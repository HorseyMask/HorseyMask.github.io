Hello. Name's Horace. Just a guy on the internet that wants to make his mark on it, and leave a record of "cool" stuff I do, so here's the blog to do it.

Currently, I'm a freshman majoring Computer Engineering in Sogang University, a Korean university.
I've got most of my experience in Java, and learning C as of now. I'm still relatively new to the area, and am always looking to learn new stuff and langauges.

Have big interests in tech, such as advancements in computer hardware, keyboards, headphones, etc. Also am a big fan of anime and manga, particularly in the slice of life genre.
Play a lot of games as well, mostly in the indie genre of Steam. But my favorite (and with most hours) would be Team Fortress 2.

Also started to venture into the world of art, and here you'd see all the horrid creations I come up with. Also in the learning process of that.

Hopefully I'll have more stuff to put here as I keep gaining experience, but for now, I hope you enjoy the content I come up with here.
